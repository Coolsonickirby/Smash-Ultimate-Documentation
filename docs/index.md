# Introduction

## Welcome to the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Modding Documentation

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Modding information is scattered everywhere on Discord, Gamebanana, and Github. This website aims to have it all collected into one place so that you can easily find information about Ultimate Modding.

Right now this will most likely just be a list of file formats and programs you can use with them as well as other reverse engineering stuff as that's the only stuff I know about, but hopefully more people will be able to contribute to other stuff.
